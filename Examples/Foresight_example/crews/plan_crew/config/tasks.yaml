    - Ensure the structure enables both high-level insight and operational usefulness
  expected_output: >
    A JSON-structured content plan with:
    - Section numbers and titles
    - Purpose, rationale, and importance
    - Research questions and methodology/framework per section
    - Content needs and guidelines per section
    - Suggested sources and evaluation rubrics
    - Logical flow from scanning to interpretation to synthesis
