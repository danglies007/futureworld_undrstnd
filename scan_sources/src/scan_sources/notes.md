- Brave - Seems to hallucinate, if just using it as standard
- Serperdev - working okay but gets stuck in a single souce
- EXA - Looks good,
  - finds diverse content
  - but makes up the source, allocating it to one of the Futurists -
  - Dates are all a problem
  - Seems to use nural search which might be the challege
  - Looking to add Exa crawl to improve content
- FireCrawl - still cant get to work
